# xdp-autosetup
Just a simple repo to automate my XDP setup. This is also like 3 years old, it just didn't exist on my Github.

Upon executing run.sh it'll install relevant packages for XDP development and setup. It'll also initialize the submodules found in this repo which contain useful headers and tools to load XDP programs.

> Note: I have only really tested this on Ubuntu 20.04 and Kernel version 4.9 or newer.
